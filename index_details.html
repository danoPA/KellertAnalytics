        <p class="paragraph_header">Welcome!</p>
        <p>
            Welcome to the 2017 edition of my NCAA tournament guide. Every year
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017">Kaggle</a>
            hosts a data science competition to see who can build the best model for predicting the tournament. The
            goal of this competition is to produce a win probability for every team in the tournament against every
            other team. For the matchups that occur, each submission is scored based on how close the probability was
            to the actual outcome. For example, if I say that Northwestern has a 90% chance of beating Kentucky and they
            win I only suffer a penalty related to the 10% difference between 100% and 90%. However, in the highly unlikely scenario that
            Northwestern loses this game I would suffer a much greater penalty related to the 90% difference 90% and 0%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The analysis I have done is intended to be used for that competition. However, this website is intended to be
            used to fill out a bracket. Win probabilities cannot fill
            out a bracket on their own, so I have created tools that will assist you in applying my research to that task.
            I have added a few features
            this year, most notably the bracket. This now allows you to view the whole bracket and see all the
            win probabilities as different teams advance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph_header" id="tools">Tool Guides</p>
        <p class="sub_paragraph_header"><a class="anchor" id="toolpr"></a>Power Rankings</p>
        <p>
            The power rankings are simply my ranking of every team in college basketball as measured by their
            opponent adjusted point differential. Only the top 25 are shown by default but the rest can be toggled
            by clicking to show more/less. Additionally, each of the tournament teams contain a link to that team's
            stats page.
        </p>
        <p class="sub_paragraph_header"><a class="anchor" id="toolstats"></a>Stats</p>
        <p>
            The stats page highlights a selection of the opponent adjusted stats that I generated for this analysis.
            All of the columns are sortable. Only the tournament teams are given in this section and all of their
            team names link to that team's stats page.
        </p>
        <p class="sub_paragraph_header"><a class="anchor" id="toolproj"></a>Projections</p>
        <p>
            The projections page allows the user to select any two teams in the tournament via drop down menus and compare them side
            by side. The probability that the first selected team beats the second is given as well as a statistical
            comparison of the two teams.
        </p>
        <p class="sub_paragraph_header"><a class="anchor" id="toolbracket"></a>Bracket</p>
        <p>
            The bracket tool gives the entire bracket (be sure to scroll or swipe around as it is very large). Each
            node in the graph, represented by a team name with seed as well as a team icon is clickable. Clicking the
            team will imply a win in that round and advance the team to the next round. When there is a valid matchup
            present the win probability for each team is presented next to the team name. There is a toggle in the
            upper left corner that allows the user to switch from win probabilities to point spreads.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a team is clicked that invalidates downstream matchups, that whole stream is cleared from the bracket.
            Refreshing the page will always reset the bracket to its original state. As the tournament progresses
            I will update the bracket to reflect the actual results, and this will become the default state.
            However, you will still be able to manipulate the entire bracket.

        <p>
            Before we get to the math which I'm sure you will all stick around for and read diligently, here are a
            few notes on how to interpret the various numbers you will see here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The probabilities are the most
            straightforward, and important, and can be found in the
            <a href="/projections">projections</a> and
            <a href="/bracket">bracket</a> pages. This is simply the probability that
            team A will beat team B. There are two important things to note here. The first is that a team with a 90%
            win probability is not guaranteed to win, and will, in fact, lose 1 in every 10 matchups with that opponent.
            The second note is around bracket strategy. If you were simply trying to give yourself the best chance to
            get every game right, you would pick the team with the higher win probability in every game. However, my
            model is not going to get every game right and neither will anyone else. Your true goal is get more games
            right than anyone else in your bracket group. To accomplish this you are going to need to pick some upsets,
            so you should look for matchups where the lower seed has a higher probability than you would expect given
            their seed. These are the upsets where you will gain an advantage over the rest of your pool. For example,
            using the chart below and everyone's favorite matchup, a 12 seed should beat a 5 seed 29% of the time, so if you see a
            12 seed with a 40% win probability then that is a good pick to gain an advantage in your pool even though
            that team is not favored (the table to the left gives all the first round seed pairings and
            you can generate more seed based expected probabilities using the formula 50 + 3*
            seed difference). My last word about this is that you should also take into account the size of your
            pool; bigger groups require more upset picks and smaller groups fewer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other numbers you will find on the site are my version of some of the basic box score statistics for
            each team. These are calculated using a recursive algorithm that accounts for opponent strength in preventing
            the statistic in question. The numbers themselves have no absolute meaning, but are scaled such that the
            highest score over the last 15 years registers as a 100 and the lowest is a 0. PtDiff, or opponent adjusted
            point differential, is the most important
            of these metrics and is, therefore, what I use for producing my power rankings.
