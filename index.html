        <p class="paragraph_header">Welcome!</p>
        <p>
            Welcome to the 2017 edition of my NCAA tournament guide. Every year
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017">Kaggle</a>
            hosts a data science competition to see who can build the best model for predicting the tournament. The
            goal of this competition is to produce a win probability for every team in the tournament against every
            other team. For the matchups that occur, each submission is scored based on how close the probability was
            to the actual outcome. For example, if I say that Northwestern has a 90% chance of beating Kentucky and they
            win I only suffer a penalty related to the 10% difference. However, in the highly unlikely scenario that
            Northwestern loses this game I would suffer a much greater penalty related to the 90% difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            The analysis I have done is intended to be used for that competition. However, win probabilities cannot fill
            out a bracket on their own, which is where this website comes into the picture. Its purpose is to assist you
            with the task of actually filling out your bracket with the power of data science. I have added a few features
            this year, most notably the bracket feature. This now allows you to view the whole bracket and see all the
            win probabilities as different teams advance.

            Finally, before we get to the math which I'm sure you will all stick around for and read diligently, here are a
            few notes on how to interpret the various numbers you will see here. The probabilities are the most
            straightforward and can be found in the projections and bracket pages. This is simply the probability that
            team A will beat team B. There are two important things to note here. The first is that a team with a 90%
            win probability is not guaranteed to win, and will, in fact, lose 1 in every 10 matchups with that opponent.
            The second note is around bracket strategy. If you were simply trying to give yourself the best chance to
            get every game right, you would pick the team with the higher win probability in every game. However, my
            model is not going to get every game right and neither will anyone else. Your true goal is get more games
            right than anyone else in your bracket group. To accomplish this you are going to need to pick some upsets,
            so you should look for matchups where the lower seed has a higher probability than you would expect given
            their seed. These are the upsets where you will gain an advantage over the rest of your pool. For example,
            using the chart below and everyone's favorite matchup, a 12 should beat a 5 29% of the time, so if you see a
            12 seed with a 40% win probability then that is a good pick to gain an advantage in your pool even though
            that team is not favored (you can generate more seed based expected probabilities using the formula 50 + 3*
            seed difference). My last word about this is that you should also take into account the size of your
            pool; bigger groups require more upset picks and smaller groups fewer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other numbers you will find on the site are my version of some of the basic box score statistics for
            each team. These are calculated using a recursive algorithm that accounts for opponent strength in preventing
            the statistic in question. The numbers themselves have no absolute meaning, but are scaled such that the
            highest score over the last 15 years registers as a 100 and the lowest is a 0. PtDiff is the most important
            of these metrics and is, therefore, what I use for producing my power rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for checking out the site and I hope we all win our braket groups with these predictions.
